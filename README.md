# csci-4020-final

Created by: Brayden Johnson

This is a repository meant to hold my final project for this course. This project is meant to perform analysis by using ANTLR to parse the grammar of parking signs found around Los Angeles.

How to run:

Download repository and run main.py, located in the "parkingsign" folder. When running it, you will be prompted for an input. Enter one of the text strings found in the "example1.txt" file to generate analysis
